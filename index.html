    <h2>About InstantDoc</h2>

    <p><strong>What Inspired InstantDoc?</strong></p>
    <p>
        December 2024 – I was studying in the lab at Multimedia University when something unexpected happened. 
        The lab supervisor started behaving strangely, and no one around knew what was happening. Suddenly, he collapsed and got hurt. 
        That was the moment we all realized something was wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
        We panicked. We asked around, but no one knew what to do. Some students started rushing up and down looking for help, 
        but by the time assistance arrived, he was already bleeding and in pain. That moment stayed with me. 
        I kept thinking, <em>What if we had known how to act immediately?</em> <em>What if help was just a tap away?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        That experience made me realize the urgent need for a simple, accessible solution that anyone could use in emergencies. 
        That's how InstantDoc was born – to provide <strong>quick first aid guidance, emergency contacts, and hospital locations</strong> when every second counts.
